					Marine Fish Keeping Hobby
				</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>
					Fish keeping is one of the oldest forms of relaxation and home aquariums are becoming more and more popular every day. Investing
					in a home aquarium can be a great experience for the entire family and it is relatively easy to take care of.
				</p>
				But it's not as intuitive as an inexperienced hobbyist may think. For example, it may not be obvious to everyone that you
				shouldn’t keep big fish in a small tank, or that small fish probably won’t fair well with larger more aggressive stock.
				<p>

				<h2>
					Personal Dealings With This Hobby
				</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>
					Ever since I was young and my parents had owned and maintained two 55 gallon Freshwater aquariums, the thought of being able
					to own a slice of the various ecosystems that inhabit the waterways of the Earth was astounding to me. Although it was
					a simple undertaking my very first dealing with my own fish keeping started with a small 5 gallon Goldfish tank when
					I was 7 years old, though I would hardly call it a tank but rather a simple bowl.
					<br />
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2008 I ended up purchasing a 55 gallon starter kit by Aqueon and filled it with freshwater fish ranging from Silver Dollars,
					Bala Sharks, Tiger Barbs, Cory Catfish, Gourami's, and a few German Blue Ram's later on down the road.
					<br />
					<br />Our 55 gallon Freshwater tank when first starting it up:

				</p>
				<p>
					When I gained enough experience I decided I wanted to start my own 20 gallon beginner saltwater tank despite thinking it'd
					be too difficult to do so as the stigma surrounding the hobby seems to say, but it's really not the case. After only
					3 months of owning the aquarium and slowly introducing fish this is what the tank looked like:
					<br />

				</p>
				<p>
					A year later this is the result after adding some easy to keep corals such as the Kenya Trees that are plentiful and the
					Green Star Polyps on the right side of the tank:
