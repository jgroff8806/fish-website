					Where to start? Seven Steps to Get You Going
				</h2>
				<hr />
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Select a fish tank.</b>
					</li>
					Saltwater fish and plant life are accustomed to living in the vast space of the ocean. Therefore, a sizable tank is necessary
					to accommodate the type of fish that will live in a saltwater aquarium. Tanks can be found in pet stores and specific
					fish stores. Previously-owned saltwater aquariums are also available on the market for less than brand new tanks. When
					choosing the size, consider where the tank will go, and how many fish are expected to live in it. Allow 10 gallons of
					water per fish. For example, 10 fish can live in a 100 gallon tank.
					<br />
					<br />

					<li>
						<b>Purchase the tank accessories.</b>
					</li>
					In addition to the tank, the aquarium will require a lid, a stand, a filter, a heater, an interior light, a thermometer and
					gravel for the bottom of the tank. A hydrometer will also be necessary to measure the salt levels in the water. Set
					up the tank and accessories before adding the water or the fish. The tank will need to be located near several electrical
					outlets. Set up the stand and make sure it is balanced and level before placing the tank on top of it.
					<br />
					<br />

					<li>
						<b>Test the tank and equipment.</b>
					</li>
					Fill the tank with freshwater and make sure all of the equipment works. Leave the water for 2 days and pay attention to any
					malfunctioning equipment or possible leaks. The water temperature should be within 2 degrees of 80 degrees Fahrenheit
					(26.7 degrees Celsius). Empty the water out of the tank after 2 successful days.
					<br />
					<br />

					<li>
						<b>Add water.</b>
					</li>
					Saltwater mix will need to be added to freshwater in a bucket and added to the tank. Follow the directions for quantity on
					the package of saltwater mix. Mix until it is completely dissolved. Continue adding buckets of water to the tank until
					it is filled.
					<br />
					<br />

					<li>
						<b>Test the saltwater.</b>
					</li>
					Take a reading with the hydrometer. An ideal salt level will be from 1.020 to 1.023.
					<br />
					<br />

					<li>
						<b>Run the aquarium for 2 or 3 days.</b>
					</li>
					Make sure the aquarium works properly, maintains a proper temperature and has a good salt level before adding fish. You also
					want to make sure it is properly cycled.
					<br />
					<br />

					<li>
						<b>Add fish.</b>
					</li>
					Put fish into the aquarium slowly. Start with 2 or 3 fish and then add more fish gradually.
